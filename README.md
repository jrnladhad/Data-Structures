# Data-Structures
Implementation of various basic abstract data types, such as stack, queue, and binary search tree in C++.

# 1. Stacks

Stack serves as a collection of elements with two principle features:
  a. Push - Adds element to stack.
  b. Pop - Removes the last element added to the stack.
Stack uses a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) structure. 

# 2. Queue

A queue is a collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order and the principal (or only) operations on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal position, 
known as enqueue, and removal of entities from the front terminal position, known as dequeue. This makes the queue a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.

# 3. Binary Search Tree

Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
  a. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
  b. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node’s key.
  c. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
